Hello, my name is Noah Menrath. I am a computer science student attending Grand Valley State University. I am learning all about the world of software development along with developing key critical thinking skills. For my hobbies, I enjoy watching shows and playing video games with my friends. I don't play it frequently but I do enjoy playing golf.
